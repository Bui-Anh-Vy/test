              My nationality is Vietnamese and I live in Ho Chi Minh City. This is the second semester of my first year in RMIT. I’m Vietnamese and I was born in Ho Chi Minh City. I’ve lived in this city for 19 years. I don’t travel often but I really love travelling. I want to go places that have delicious foods, beautiful scenery and fresh air.  My hobby is watching and reading, but I prefer reading novels. I like outdoor activities such as badminton, swimming, rollerblading. I also like playing piano. My favorite pets are cats especially Munchkins.

          I choose IT because I feel it is very interesting with what we do with technology, I am not suitable to communicate with many people and like to calculate. Moreover, the IT industry has a great job potential when graduating and have good income.
I have become interesting in computer when I am in grade 8. At that time, I had to take a job exam to prepare for the exam when I finished grade 9 and computer science was compulsory subject in my school. I studied about Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Pascal and how to create a basic website. Then I found computer and science is very useful and decided to choose IT when I applied for the university entrance exam.
