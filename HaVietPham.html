            The IT professional that has agreed to be interviewed by our team is called Nhat Trung, currently working as a data analyst for the banking industry. As the world is becoming more digitized and people are quickly switching to cards instead of cash payments, the banking industry is growing to a new height each year. Trung builds and maintains reporting systems with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and Microsoft Power BI Report Server and provides support to the end users. The department that he works in interacts with the sales center to understand customer needs and help them improve their sales performance as well as with the internal infrastructure department who supports them by keeping the servers running the systems. The most time spent on his work is in analyzing and building data for the reporting system, and the most challenging part of the job is designing and implementing a new system as it requires all technical aspects and timeline. Trung believes that the essence of the IT industry is to provide the end users services with the best quality and improve people’s lives. Regarding his personal experience in the IT industry, Trung shares that he didn’t choose his career but instead it chose him. He has always been interested in programming since high school. For someone coming into the industry, he suggests reading newspapers and catching up on IT trends such as the future with AI. Trung has been a part of his company for over 5 years and is seeing himself retiring with it. Trung works from 8AM to 5PM everyday and finds 40 hours a week enough. His favorite tradition/culture in the company is the rewards when one utilises creativity and creates something new, whether it’s a design or a system or a new solution to improve efficiency. Our IT professional is an ESTP who is known as the doers and enjoys listening to music, playing MMO strategy games as well as tennis. We asked him what advice he would give his past self and Trung said to “choose a certain career and do it best”. Trung has an interesting work-life balance and he’s doing great in the IT section of the banking industry. He was an interesting person to interview and get to know.
